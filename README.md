# Ozymandias Chatroom
An ephemeral chatroom built in Express and Node.

## What is this
Lets users create their own private chatrooms, share links, and type in Markdown.

## Try it
- Visit the chatroom here: https://secretchat.herokuapp.com

- Type your [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) into the box on the left and see it converted on the right.

- Type your room name after the dash in the URL, and discover a way to quickly chat with friends.

`(https://secretchat.herokuapp.com/whatever!)`

## Features

- Share the link with friends, and chat with them in real-time. No sign-up needed.

- Nothing is recorded and anything deleted is **gone forever**.

- Wander into rooms, meet strangers and new friends, and realize the constant risk of being forgotten.

- `$ git clone https://github.com/janaipakos/Ozymandias-Chatroom.git`
- `$ npm install`
- `$ heroku create`
